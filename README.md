Please implement the following features for our Node.js/React application:

### 1. Razorpay Payment Integration
- Integrate Razorpay for payments using these test keys:
  - `key_id`: `rzp_test_tqQfVSBUtw7Yju`
  - `key_secret`: `wH4TK2HioN3pNUYztWqf4xZ5`
- Create backend APIs to:
  - Check payment status
  - Create Razorpay orders for live courses, recorded courses, and projects
  - Handle Razorpay webhook for order completion (update payment/order status on success)

### 2. Wishlist & Cart Functionality
- Implement backend APIs for:
  - Adding/removing items (courses/projects) to/from a user’s wishlist
  - Adding/removing items to/from a user’s cart
  - Viewing wishlist and cart contents

### 3. Checkout API
- Implement a checkout API that:
  - Initiates a Razorpay order for the items in the cart
  - Returns order details to the frontend for payment

### 4. Web Checkout Page
- Create a React checkout page that:
  - Displays order summary
  - Integrates Razorpay JS SDK for payment
  - Handles payment success/failure and updates backend accordingly

### 5. Routing & Models
- Ensure all APIs are properly routed and secured
- Create/update models for wishlist, cart, and orders as needed

### 6. Reference
- The features should work for live courses, recorded courses, and projects.
- Use the provided test keys for development.
- Follow best practices for error handling, security, and code organization.

---

**Goal:**  
A complete payment flow with wishlist, cart, checkout, Razorpay integration, and webhook handling for all course/project types.

---

1. **Save Razorpay API Keys Securely**
   - Store the Razorpay `key_id` and `key_secret` in the .env file (not in code).
   - Load these keys from environment variables in your backend payment integration.

2. **Grant User Access After Purchase**
   - After a user successfully completes payment for a course or project (via Razorpay), update the backend so:
     - The purchased course/project is saved to the user’s account (e.g., in a `UserCourses` or `UserProjects` table).
     - The user can access their purchased items from their profile/dashboard page.

3. **Access Control**
   - Ensure only users who have purchased a course/project can access/download/view it from their profile.

---

**Goal:**  
- Secure payment keys in .env.
- Automatically grant access to purchased courses/projects after payment.
- Users see and access their purchases in their profile.

---



================================================================================
================================================================================
================================================================================



Please refactor and update the codebase as follows:

1. **Combine Live Course Logic**
   - Merge the live course controller and routes into the main course controller and course routes.
   - Remove the separate live course controller and route files.
   - Ensure all live course features are handled within the unified course controller and routes.

2. **Frontend: Recorded Course Lesson Video Upload**
   - In the recorded course lesson add/edit form, replace the video URL input with a file upload field.
   - After uploading the video, use the uploaded file’s URL for the lesson.
   - Ensure the video upload and URL assignment work correctly in the UI and backend.

3. **Course API Connection Check**
   - Review all course-related APIs and ensure they are correctly connected and functional between frontend and backend.

4. **Combine Course Purchase Logic**
   - Merge the course purchase controller and routes into the payment controller and payment routes.
   - Remove the separate course purchase controller and route files.
   - Refactor the course purchase model: remove it or combine its logic into the order model.
   - Ensure all course purchase features are handled within the unified payment controller, routes, and order model.

---

**Goal:**  
- Simplified, unified controllers and routes for courses and payments.
- Video upload for recorded course lessons.
- All APIs are correctly connected and functional.

### Questions & Requests

- Why are there two separate "course create order" functionalities?
- Please remove the course-specific create order routes and functions.
- How does a user apply a discount code to their current cart?
- Is the discount code functionality currently working?
- The create order feature should support both projects and courses (live & recorded).
- In the projects get/course get, do not show the files if the user has not purchased the course/project.
- Do not allow the user to download the files if they have not purchased the course/project.
- Ensure the user can only access/download/view the course/project if they have purchased it.
- Please ensure the course and project models are updated to reflect the new discount system.
- Ensure the course and project models have fields for discounts, promo codes, and other necessary attributes.
- Only the course/project purchased users can review & rate the course/project.
- use the courseRating, projectRating, instructorRating models to store the ratings and reviews.
- and create the necessary APIs to handle the ratings and reviews.





Create a profile update api for student and use the userControllers and userRoutes to handle the profile update functionality.




Remove the createdBy in the project & course controllers and models. because we have home seperate projectInstructor and courseInstructor tables now.

and also remove the languageId in the course model and controller. because we have a separate courseLanguage, projectLanguage tables now.

and also in the getAll and get by id endpoints, remove the createdBy and languageId from the response. and add the instructors and languages array got from the courseLanguage & projectLanguage and courseInstructor & projectInstructor tables.

and in the course and project models on get the item by id endpoints, include the course lessons, sections and the project files in the response.

and also add the sections and lessons in the seedData
if the lesson type is live, then add the streamStartDateTime and streamEndDateTime fields in the lesson model and controller. and it is for live courses only.
if the lesson type is video, then add the videoUrl field in the lesson model and controller. and it is for both live & recorded courses.
if the lesson type is document or assignment, then use the courseFile model and controller to upload the document file and get the fileUrl and fileName fields in the lesson model and controller. and it is for both live & recorded courses.






remove the fileUrl & filename fields from the lesson model and controller. because we are using the courseFile model and controller to handle the document files.

and remove the lessons, sections, files creation on create/edit course & projects api endpoint.
and create a new endpoints for managing course (lessons and sections and files) project (files) separately.

and also fix this error on db sync
Error syncing model Project: column "language_id" does not exist
SQL that failed: CREATE INDEX "projects_language_id" ON "projects" ("language_id")
Parent error: column "language_id" does not exist

and after that test the sync db and seedData with the new changes. and fix any issues that arise during the sync and seedData execution.



in the backend i have already created the ratings routes and ratings controller. please use the code. and you can also create new routes in the same ratingRoute.js and ratingController.js,

and so you need to create/edit four pages in the frontend for projects:
1. Project Details View Page
2. Instructors Management Page
3. Reviews & Ratings Management Page
4. Files Management Page


Project details (model/project.js) (controller/projectController.js) (routes/projectRoutes.js)
    - show the project details.
    - edit button that navigates to the edit page.
    - delete button that deletes the project.
Instructors (model/projectInstructor.js) (controller/instructorController.js) (routes/instructorRoutes.js)
    - list the users who are instructors for the project.
    - add/remove instructors for the project.
Reviews & Ratings (model/projectRating.js) (controller/ratingController.js) (routes/ratingRoutes.js)
    - bar chart showing the average rating of the project.
    - list the reviews & ratings for the project.
    - add/edit/delete reviews & ratings.
Files List for this project (model/projectFile.js) (controller/projectFileController.js) (routes/projectFileRoutes.js)
    - list the files for the project.
    - add/edit/delete files for the project.
    - upload files for the project.
    - download files for the project.

frontend/src/pages/admin/projects/
create/update the project details view page.

and inside that show the reviews & ratings of the project. user list of purchases, and instructors of the projects.

and the list of files for the project.

and in the list of files. use the projectFile model to show the files. and also the add/edit/delete file functionality for the project.

and the reviews & ratings should be shown in the project view page. and the admin can edit/delete the reviews & ratings.

and the admin can add/remove instructors for the project.

please refer the backend code and and do the frontend code accordingly. and also if any routes/ endpoints are needed, please create them. and you can also modify the existing routes/endpoints if needed.

the in the project list view eye button -> go to the details page

in that page.
Project details (model/project.js) (controller/projectController.js) (routes/projectRoutes.js)
    - show the project details.
    - edit button that navigates to the edit page.
    - delete button that deletes the project.
Instructors (model/projectInstructor.js) (controller/projectController.js) (routes/projectRoutes.js)
    - list the users who are instructors for the project.
    - add/remove instructors for the project.
Reviews & Ratings (model/projectRating.js) (controller/ratingController.js) (routes/ratingRoutes.js)
    - bar chart showing the average rating of the project.
    - list the reviews & ratings for the project.
    - add/edit/delete reviews & ratings.
Files List for this project (model/projectFile.js) (controller/projectFileController.js) (routes/projectFileRoutes.js)
    - list the files for the project.
    - add/edit/delete files for the project.
    - upload files for the project.
    - download files for the project.





and in the files list view for the project is not working. so please fix that. and also make the add/edit/delete files functionality for the project. (refer the projectFile model, projectFileRoutes.js, projectFileController.js)
and the instructors if i delete and add the same instructor again, it is not working. so please fix that too.
and the ratings delete is not working for projects. so please fix that too.

Just like how you did for projects create a new page for courses details view page.
and inside that show the reviews & ratings of the course. user list of purchases, and instructors of the course sections & lessons.
so the course view page should have the following sections:
Course details (model/course.js) (controller/courseController.js) (routes/courseRoutes.js)
    - show the course details.
    - edit button that navigates to the edit page.
    - delete button that deletes the course.
Instructors (model/courseInstructor.js) (controller/courseController.js) (routes/courseRoutes.js)
    - list the users who are instructors for the course.
    - add/remove instructors for the course.
Reviews & Ratings (model/courseRating.js) (controller/ratingController.js) (routes/ratingRoutes.js)
    - bar chart showing the average rating of the course.
    - list the reviews & ratings for the course.
    - add/edit/delete reviews & ratings.
Sessions & Lessons (model/courseSection.js, model/courseLesson.js) (controller/courseController.js) (routes/courseRoutes.js)
    - list the sections and lessons for the course.
    - add/edit/delete sections and lessons for the course.
    - upload files for the lessons.
    - add content for the lessons.

so you need to create/edit four pages in the frontend for courses;
and you need to edit the existing pages in the projects. and also the backend nodejs code for the projects and courses.

and after all the frontend and backend code is done, please test the complete flow of the courses and projects. and also the ratings and reviews, instructors, sections, lessons, files, etc.




From the new live, new recorded, edit live, edit recorded jsx file remove the sections and lessons.
and add it in the tab of the course details view page.

and the live & recorded course list page on click view eye icon is showing 404 error.

and in the project files the upload API is not working. first call the file upload API and then get the file URL and then save it into the projectFiles
and to upload the file refer the fileUploadRoutes.js file with the upload-fields and the field name is project-files

and also please please check if the project files are being saved in the database or not. and also implement the file upload in the lessons and sections of the courses like how you did for the projects.

and also in the live course and edit pages the start and end date time is react component is not working. so the whole page is crashing.

and refer the code in the project coverImage and screenshot and implement the same for the course coverImage and screenshot.

and just like the project screenshots implement the file upload for the projectFiles for projects and courseFiles for sections and lessons. 

and change the project reviews and ratings view tab in the details page just like the course reviews and ratings view tab in the details page.

and change the new recorded course add page (new-recorded.jsx) and add the newly implemented changed to that file.







the projectFiles upload button click on the details page needs to show the multi file uploader just like the project screenshots field in project/new.jsx file. and also change the API's for that. i need the same design in the dialog as the project screenshots field in the project/new.jsx file.

and also in the live-list, recorded-list and project list pages, the table pagination is not working. so please fix that.
and also the filters are not working in the live-list and recorded-list pages. so please fix that too.

and change the section and lesson add/edit pages to match the new lesson types and their fields.
- Create new page for lesson edit/add instead of the popup inside the course
- For the the video upload is not working because the forms is showing in the dialog and not in the new page.


and these are the lesson types in the course sections:
"video", "live", "quiz", "assignment", "document"
so change the course update form in the dialog based on the lesson type.
Video 
- create a single video upload field. and save the file in the courseFile model as videoUrl. and lint it with the sectionId and lessonId.
- single video can be uploaded for the video lesson type.
Live
- create a date time picker for the live start and end date time. and save it in the lesson model as streamStartDateTime and streamEndDateTime.
Quiz
- for now show as "Quiz" and later we will implement the quiz functionality.
Assignment
- create a file upload field for the assignment document. and save it in the courseFile model. and link it with the sectionId and lessonId.
- multiple files can be uploaded for the assignment.

so please remove the videourl field from the lesson model and controller, and also remove the videoUrl field from the course edit page. also the file upload designs needs to be look like the project screenshots field in the project/new.jsx file.


in the projects change the component named ProjectFilesView inside the details.jsx file. but now you changed the files.jsx file in the projects

i have changed the paths of the lesson edit and lesson new pages in the paths.js file.

so please create the routes in the src/routes/sections/admin.jsx file for the lesson edit and lesson new pages. like below
`/courses/${courseid}/lesson/${lessonid}/edit`,
`/courses/${courseid}/lesson/new`,






please use the profileFileController.js file for project file changes. not it is using the fileController.js file.
and use these functionalities.
  deleteProjectFile,
  uploadProjectFiles,
  uploadLessonVideo
and also on update functionality, is not working. and in the update request if there is no file, then do no update the file, just update the name and description. 

and in the lessons add/edit the content will be in the richtext html editor.

}

and it shows section not found. please check lesson add/edit and delete functionality in the lesson routes and controller files. and also please check if it is working in the frontend or not.







now fix the backend code to handle this error gracefully and ensure that the file upload process does not crash the application.
and in the frontend add the loading animation on the button while the file is being uploaded.

the delete is not working
http://localhost:8080/api/project-files/4c3cceb8-191e-4c53-b1ad-c7371ed05d21/files
404 Not Found

in the add file and edit file dialog boxes must be same. and remove the fille type from the edit form dialog boxes
and in the add 

so in the add dialog 
- multiple image upload
- file type should not be there

so in the edit dialog
- file name
- description
- single file upload

- and on both dialogs add the loading animation on the button while the file is being uploaded.

and also change the controller for this new functionality.




please use the profileFileController.js file for project file changes. not it is using the fileController.js file.
and also on update functionality, is not working. and in the update request if there is no file, then do no update the file, just update the name and description. 

use these funcitons 
  deleteProjectFile,
  uploadProjectFiles
